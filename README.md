# Vanilla Memory Game üç¶

## About  
A food-themed memory game inspired by [Ania Kub√≥w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjyDOHzKN0w). One thing is to follow the tutorial and code along, but since it was a short tutorial, I decided to watch it first. From there on, I pseudo-coded for my own memroy game project. This way I can understand what steps I have to take when writing my own code.   
The tutorial's code is practical resource to be used as a reference. In the video, Ania says that thememory game is coded in a simple manner. Meaning, the code can be tweaked/refactored however I  wanted. And that is what I did.
