# Vanilla Memory Game üç¶

## About  
A food-themed memory game inspired by [Ania Kub√≥w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjyDOHzKN0w). 
* A set of cards are shown with their back cover towards the user. 
* The user clicks two cards. The cards flip to see if they match. 
* When there is no match, the cards are flipped back. 
* The user has to choose two cards again and see if they match. If all cards are matched, the game is over.

## Reflection
One thing is to follow the tutorial and code along, but since it was a short tutorial, I decided to watch it first. From there on, I pseudo-coded for my own memory game project. This way I can understand what steps I have to take when writing my own code.   
The tutorial's code is practical resource to be used as a reference. In the video, Ania mentions the memory game being coded in a simple manner. Meaning, I can tweak/refactor the code however I wanted. And that is what I did. 

## Built with
